//   spending — money genuinely consumed (food, fuel, power)
//   fee      — M-PESA's cut
//   transfer — money moved, not spent (own bank accounts, savings, loan repayments)
//   income   — money in
// The dashboard's headline "spent" figure counts `spending` + `fee` only. A 96k Zenka
// repayment is real, but it is debt servicing; letting it sit in the same bucket as
// groceries would make every other number invisible.

// row label sitting next to each bar.
// Mutated in place by registerCustomCategories, never reassigned — every module
// imports this same object, so adding a category makes it appear everywhere at once
