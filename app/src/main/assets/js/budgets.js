// Budget LINES are structure — which app categories a household line covers — and
// belong in the code. The AMOUNTS are yours, so they ship at zero and live in your
// browser's storage. What someone budgets for rent says a lot about them, and this
// code has to be hosted for a phone to install it.
//
// The lines don't map 1:1 onto categories, because a household thinks in intents
// ("rent + water + gas") while the app categorises by what the merchant is. Each
// line therefore covers a LIST of categories, stated rather than guessed at.

import { monthResolver, cycleStartOf } from './salary.js';

// Bump when the LINES change (a new line, a re-mapped category) so installs that
// already stored the old lines pick up the new structure — see store.budgets().
// v2: split Electricity + Househelp onto their own categories, and gave every
// remaining spending category a line so nothing real hides in "outside any budget".
export const BUDGET_SEED_VERSION = 2;

// Every SPENDING category maps to exactly one line here, except Uncategorised — that
// one is left out on purpose so "outside any budget" means "money I haven't identified
// yet", a triage list, rather than a vague catch-all. Transfers, savings, loan
// repayments and fees are not spending and never belong on a budget line (budgetReport
// filters them out of the outside figure too).
